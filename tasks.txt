all the same

what is the use of tghe labels button in the eri diagrm toolbar please
remove it


date field should be a date picker when i double click to edit in the
data grid in the data explorer page


what other logic is in the query page that can be moved to hook

we need tooltips so let;s start from this query editor page, add tooltip to the clear button "clear results" and also to the visual builder and the ai assistant button "open visual query builder" and "open ai assistant panel"
